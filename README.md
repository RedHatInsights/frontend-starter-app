# frontend-starter-app

React.js starter app for Red Hat Insights products that includes Patternfly 4 and shared Red Hat cloud service frontend components.

## Alternative

Before using this template, please check the [create-crc-app](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-components/blob/master/packages/docs/pages/ui-onboarding/create-crc-app.mdx). It has some extra setup you may like.

## Initial etc/hosts setup

In order to access the https://[env].foo.redhat.com in your browser, you have to add entries to your `/etc/hosts` file. This is a **one-time** setup that has to be done only once (unless you modify hosts) on each devel machine.

Best way is to edit manually `/etc/hosts` on your localhost line:

```
127.0.0.1 <your-fqdn> localhost prod.foo.redhat.com stage.foo.redhat.com
```

Alternatively you can do this by running following command:
```bash
npm run patch:hosts
```

If this command throws an error run it as a `sudo`:
```bash
sudo npm run patch:hosts
```

## Getting started

1. ```npm install```

2. ```PROXY=true npm run start:beta```

3. Open browser in URL listed in the terminal output

Update `config/dev.webpack.config.js` according to your application URL. [Read more](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-components/tree/master/packages/config#useproxy).

### Testing

`npm run verify` will run `npm run lint` (eslint) and `npm test` (Jest)

## Deploying

- The starter repo uses Travis to deploy the webpack build to another Github repo defined in `.travis.yml`
  - That Github repo has the following branches:
    - `ci-beta` (deployed by pushing to `master` or `main` on this repo)
    - `ci-stable` (deployed by pushing to `ci-stable` on this repo)
    - `qa-beta` (deployed by pushing to `qa-beta` on this repo)
    - `qa-stable` (deployed by pushing to `qa-stable` on this repo)
    - `prod-beta` (deployed by pushing to `prod-beta` on this repo)
    - `prod-stable` (deployed by pushing to `prod-stable` on this repo)
- Travis uploads results to RedHatInsight's [codecov](https://codecov.io) account. To change the account, modify CODECOV_TOKEN on https://travis-ci.com/.
